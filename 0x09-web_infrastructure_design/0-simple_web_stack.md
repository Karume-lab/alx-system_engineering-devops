Simple Web Stack

Below is a step-by-step explanation of a simple web stack
User Accessing the Website:
When a user wants to access the website, they enter the URL www.foobar.com in their web browser.

Domain Name and DNS:
The domain name, in this case, is foobar.com. It serves as the address of the website. The user's request reaches the DNS (Domain Name System), which translates the domain name into an IP address. In this scenario, the DNS should have a DNS record (specifically, an A record) for the www subdomain, pointing to the server's IP address, which is 8.8.8.8.

Server:
The server is a physical or virtual machine that hosts the web infrastructure. It is responsible for receiving and processing requests from users and serving the website content. In this case, we have a single server that will handle all the components of the infrastructure.

Web Server (Nginx):
The web server, such as Nginx, is software installed on the server. It receives HTTP requests from users and delivers web pages or other resources. It acts as an intermediary between the user's web browser and the application server. The web server handles tasks like routing requests, serving static files, and handling SSL encryption.

Application Server:
The application server runs the application code, also known as the code base. It is responsible for processing dynamic requests and generating responses. It executes the business logic, interacts with databases, and delivers the requested data or performs necessary actions. In this infrastructure, we assume there is an application server running the code for the website.

Database (MySQL):
The database stores and manages the website's data. MySQL is a popular relational database management system. The application server communicates with the database to retrieve or store data, such as user information, blog posts, or product details.

Communication with User's Computer:
To communicate with the user's computer, the server uses the internet and the HTTP protocol. When the user requests a web page, the server sends the corresponding HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other resources back to the user's computer, which the web browser interprets and renders as a web page.

Now let's address the issues with this infrastructure:

Single Point of Failure (SPOF):
Since this infrastructure relies on a single server, it becomes a single point of failure. If the server experiences any hardware or software issues, the entire website will be affected and become inaccessible.

Downtime during Maintenance:
Performing maintenance, such as deploying new code, may require restarting the web server. During this process, the website may experience downtime, resulting in temporary unavailability for users.

Scalability Limitations:
With only one server, the infrastructure cannot easily handle a high influx of incoming traffic. If the website experiences a surge in visitors, the server may become overwhelmed, leading to slow response times or even crashes
